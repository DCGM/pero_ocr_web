                    The application allows users to automatically transcribe several types of printed and handwritten documents.
                    The provided OCR engines are able to transcribe even very low-quality printed documents in most european languages including Latin,
                    old documents in Fraktur and similar scripts in German and Czech, and handwritten documents mainly in Czech language.
                    The application provides efficient interface for text corrections and several
                    formats of transcriptions for download (ALTO, PAGE XML, plain text).
