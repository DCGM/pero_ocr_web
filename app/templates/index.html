                    This application demonstrates capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/DCGM/pero-ocr" target="_blank">pero-ocr</a> python
                    package developed in <a href="https://pero.fit.vutbr.cz/" target="_blank">project PERO</a> at Brno University of Technology.
                    You can create an account and use the application to transcribe documents. To get an idea how well the OCR works,
                    you can view <a href="{{ url_for('document.public_documents') }}">Public documents</a>.
                    If you have any questions or if you experience any problems, contact <a href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/ihradis">Michal Hradiš</a>.

                    The application allows users to automatically transcribe several types of printed and handwritten documents.
                    The provided OCR engines are able to transcribe even very low-quality printed documents in most european languages including Latin,
                    old documents in Fraktur and similar scripts in German and Czech, and handwritten documents mainly in Czech language.
                    The application provides efficient interface for text corrections and several
                    formats of transcriptions for download (ALTO, PAGE XML, plain text).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The application is free for personal use and any use which involves manual text correction.
